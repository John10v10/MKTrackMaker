# MKTrackMaker
Hey guys, this is a newly developped idea. I'm right now at the very beginning stages of development, but I don't plan to continue unless if the Mario Kart modding community would want a tool like this.

<h3>What is the purpose of this program?</h3>
The basic idea is to make custom Mario Kart tracks as easy as putting a toy train track together, where people can make a track without the need for 3D modeling skills. Models can be created by 3D modelers from the modding communuity, and be downloaded into the program so kids and creative track makers can use them in their tracks.

My drawing shown above is an illustration that is supposed to be a kid putting a toy race car track together as he imagines the track as a rainbow road Mario is riding on.


This is what the program currently looks like: <img src="https://github.com/John10v10/MKTrackMaker/raw/master/ScreenShot.png" width="80%">
