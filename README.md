# MKTrackMaker
Hey guys, this is a newly developped idea. I'm right now at the very beginning stages of development, but I don't plan to continue unless if the Mario Kart modding community would want a tool like this.
Anyway, the basic idea is to make it as easy to make custom Mario Kart tracks as it is to put together a toy train track, where people without 3D modeling skills can still make a track.
This is what the program currently looks like: <img src="https://github.com/John10v10/MKTrackMaker/raw/master/ScreenShot.png" width="80%">
